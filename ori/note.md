AUTHOR'S NOTE 

The purpose of this book is to present the case against sugar-both sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup as the principal cause of the chronic diseases that are most likely to kill us, or at least accelerate our demise, in the twenty-first century. Its goal is to explain why these sugars are the most likely suspects, and how we arrived at the current situation: a third of all adults are obese, two-thirds overweight, almost one in seven is diabetic, and one in four to five will die of cancer; yet the prime suspects for the dietary trigger of these conditions have been, until the last decade, treated as little worse than a source of harmless pleasure. 

If this were a criminal case, The Case Against Sugar would be the argu- ment for the prosecution.
